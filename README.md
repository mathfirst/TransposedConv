# TransposedConv
In this repo, I wrote some code to verify Pytorch convolution related APIs, including transposed convolution. Specifically, you may know what convolution means in terms of image processing and then write code to perform those operations and compare what you get with what Pytorch APIs give. This is what I mean by verification.
